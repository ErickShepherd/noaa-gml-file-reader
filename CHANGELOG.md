## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-08

Modernization release. **Breaking** — the package is renamed and unparseable
input now raises instead of returning an empty DataFrame.

### Changed
- **Renamed** the package: import `noaa_esrl_gmd_file_reader` →
  `noaa_gml_file_reader`, distribution `noaa-gml-file-reader`. NOAA renamed
  ESRL's Global Monitoring Division (GMD) to the Global Monitoring Laboratory
  (GML) in 2020.
- **`read_data` now auto-detects the header dialect** and parses both the legacy
  `# number_of_header_lines:` format and the current `# header_lines :` format,
  extracting column names correctly for each.
- Documented missing-value sentinels (`-999.99`, `-999.999`, `nan`) are mapped to
  `NaN` so numeric columns parse numeric.
- **Relicensed** AGPL-3.0 → MIT.
- Modern packaging: `pyproject.toml` (hatchling), package split into
  `_reader.py`, full type hints, and updated docstrings.

### Added
- `UnrecognizedFormatError` (carries the file path and its first line), raised on
  unrecognized, malformed, truncated, or empty input.
- Offline pytest suite over committed fixtures and a GitHub Actions CI workflow
  (ruff + pytest on Python 3.10–3.13 + `python -m build` + `twine check`).

### Removed
- The silent empty-DataFrame return on parse failure (v1 behavior) — it made a
  parse failure indistinguishable from an empty file, so v1 failed silently on
  every current NOAA file.

### Fixed
- Current (post-2020) NOAA GML files now parse instead of returning empty.
- The inconsistent GPL/AGPL wording in the v1 module docstring (removed; the
  LICENSE file governs).

## [1.0.2] — 2020-04-13

### Changed
- Linted the module: removed unused imports, added an encoding declaration, and
  removed trailing whitespace.

## [1.0.1] — 2020-03-29

### Changed
- `read_data` now returns an empty `pandas.DataFrame` (instead of `None`) when it
  fails to read a file.

## [1.0.0] — 2020-03-25

### Added
- Initial build developed and released.
